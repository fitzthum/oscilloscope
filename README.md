# oscilloscope

There are a million oscilloscope programs out there, but not very many of them will generate a video for you. This was inpsired by some videos I found on YouTube that have music synchronized to the scope. This will make that kind of thing. 
This is really not a great implementation, though. You can probably do a lot better.
